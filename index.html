    <div class="textborder">Personality<div class="textinfo">
        Kazusa has a tendency to show two sides: a melancholy and somber Kazusa, as opposed to a girl with good humor who isn't shy about speaking her mind. She can be a bit depressing at times due to her unique situation, but she tries not to dwell overly long on what could have been. Her disability doesn't define her, she likes to insist; but she does acknowledge that it has contributed to her strong force of personality.
      
      She loves animals and interaction. Sometimes, she longs for freedom; despite the Goddess giving her a second chance, she finds it ironic that she is in a similar situation as before, stricken by strange afflictions that make her weaker than normal. Young as she is, she can be convinced that there is more ahead of her than just sadness.</div>

    <div class="textborder">Backstory<div class="textinfo">
        The daughter of a Japanese zaibatsu kingpin and a British politician. Kazusa Spencer was born with an unidentified degenerative disease that robbed her of the use of her legs early on in life, as well as contributing to her declining health and extremely short life expectancy. Unfortunate circumstances considering that she had been otherwise born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and the best care that all of Earth could provide.
      
Even despite the access to priority healthcare, and despite her best efforts to integrate into society as a normal girl, it was not to be. Confined to a hospital bed as early as eight years old, she'd spent most of her time in a state of declining health. Tutoring became unnecessary after a point, when it was declared she wouldn't live past her fourteenth birthday; she'd wished fervently that she might one day get a second lease on life when she ultimately perished.
      
      It was ironic then that she'd been drawn into the Lost World shortly after her real death; she'd been reborn as a noble's daughter, a beautiful young woman with blonde hair and red eyes like she'd had in the past. It was a sick joke, however, that she'd still grown up with a similar yet different ailment that prevented her from walking around normally -- known as the Princess with No Legs, she loathes the thought of doing any fighting to reclaim the world, even if that is her purpose.</div>

    <div class="textborder">Misc. Info<div class="textinfo">
      <b>How they were brought into the world:</b>
        
      Due to an unspecified degenerative disease, Kazusa died two months after her fourteenth birthday. She was reborn fourteen years prior to current day, and is now roughly the same age as she was on Earth.
      
      <b>Current Residence</b>
      Bradford, in the residence of the Beinhorn family.
      
      <b>Extra Info</b>
      While she continues to be referred to as Kazusa Spencer Shinawa, her proper name in the Lost World is "Eleonore Beinhorn". For all intents and purposes, Eleonore Beinhorn is the name she uses on all documentation or legal script.
